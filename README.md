### (Introduction)

## Every Season is Beerable

Winter is a season for brown beers, high on alcohol to warm us up, while summer makes us crave a lighter blond beer. But do we really observe trends based on seasons? In fact, each individual may tend to consume different beers based on its mood or feeling influenced by the season. A study of a high variety of beer styles may help to see if some beers have variable success rate accross the year or inversely have a constant consumption rate. After identifying the seasonal tendencies, we will observe if those tendencies varies accross the year, i.e. is the beer success ephemere or anchored in the consumption habits of beer drinkers? Seeing this seasonal variability, we will investigate the comment's enthusiasm for a beer accross season and see if this correlates with the seasonal cyles observed. Finally, we will see how the beweries take advantage of those cyclic consumption rates in their beer proposal.
